        <h1>Edgar De Mesa</h1>
        <h2>I am an Information Management and Technology major interested in Information Security and Networking Services.</h2>
        <p>I am a proud Army veteran. My greatest accomplishments and skills came from my time in the service. I am a creative problem solver, with unique team leadership skills. I currently intern for Upstate Medical University's Information Management and Technology department.
        Outside of work I love to spend time with my partner and playing basketball. I like looking at books and not reading them. I also like to play video games. I really love cooking. If I can cook for the rest of my life, I would.</p>
        <p>I am <strong> eager </strong> to build a <strong> beautiful </strong> websitse!</p>
